adventure game system

Developing a PHP/MySQL backend and a tablet-friendly frontend for an adventure system. 

Based on the 'Old World' of Warhammer Fantasy and historical games like HeroQuest, Talisman and Warhammer Quest, the player controls a band of four heroes to travel trough the game world, visiting places, encountering NPC's and performing quests to gain experience  and wealth. They do that by entering labyrinths, fighting monsters, avoiding traps and finding treasures. 

- Between quests, the band travels the world. During that time, they can visit shops to exchange gold for valuable items or sell excess items. They can also level up. Not every path is without risk or cost though... 

- By visiting taverns and the like, they can encounter heroes and exchange heroes in the band or fill in vacant spaces caused by heroes  dying on a quest. 

- The player starts with one single character. First he has to find thee companions (ale house). Then he has to do some shopping (village market). Next he visits the castle to get his first quest...
