2 SWORD OF POWER

The last Warrior to brave the perils of the fighting pit took a sword of great power to help him slay the Minotaur that dwelt within it. However, despite the sword he was destroyed by the Minotaur and his body eaten. The sword now lies rusting at the bottom of the pit. The sword in question was an ancient heirloom stolen from the Barbarian’s father many years ago, and the Barbarian has sworn to get it back. He must therefore descend into the dungeon and kill the Minotaur himself. The other Warriors may accompany him, but it must be the Barbarian who slays the beast and retrieves the sword.

SPECIAL RULES
This is a straightforward dungeon - the Warriors must find the pit, and the Barbarian must slay the Minotaur who lives in it and reclaim his father’s sword. The only problem is that the Barbarian doesn’t want any help with killing the Minotaur - not even magic or missile weapons.

Of course, this means that the Barbarian is the only Warrior that will get any gold for killing the Minotaur! If the Barbarian manages to retrieve the sword, while using it he gets +1 on his roll to go berserk.

THE FIGHTING PIT
When the Warriors reach the objective room do not roll on the Objective Room Monster Table, as the following special rules apply.

When the Warriors enter the objective room place a Minotaur in any square in the pit. The Minotaur will not climb out of the pit unless attacked by a Warrior with missile weapons or magic. The Minotaur attacks in the Monsters’ Phase as normal. See the Rule Book for the Minotaur’s profile. However, this Minotaur is particularly powerful and gets an extra 5 Wounds.

Once the Minotaur is defeated, the Warriors may retrieve the sword and escape the dungeon through the portcullis in the far wall.
