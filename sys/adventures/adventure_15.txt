5 MAN EATER

In the Drak Wald Forest of the Empire there are rumours circulating of a man-eating monster that is raiding nearby villages and eating the inhabitants. According to the story, the monster is a great Minotaur, but no-one has actually seen the beast and lived to tell the tale. The villagers are so worried that they are staying indoors and doing no work. The local sheriffs, therefore, have intervened to solve the problem once and for all. They have located the entrance to a cave system, deep in the gloomy forest, and have employed the Warriors to kill the beast that lives within.

However, it isn’t certain that the monster is a Minotaur at all, as the villagers are renowned for scaremongering...

THE FIGHTING PIT
When the Warriors reach the fighting pit, roll on the Objective Room Monster Table, subtracting 1 from the dice roll, to determine the nature of the beast and its pack (a roll of 1 still counts as a i, of course).

If the beast turns out to be a Minotaur, the Warriors must kill it and return its head to the village. If they are successful, they will be rewarded with all the villagers’ wealth. Unfortunately, this amounts to no more than 10 gold each, as it is a very poor village. If the beast isn’t a Minotaur, the Warriors are scorned by the villagers, who don’t believe them, and go unrewarded.
