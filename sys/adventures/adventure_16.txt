6 FREE THE PRISONERS

During a recent raid on Miragliano, the Skaven took around twenty wealthy and influential citizens as captives, and have been making all manner of unreasonable and outrageous threats ever since.

The Skaven know full well that their unconditional demands to hand over all the wealth, women and children of the city will never be agreed to, but it gives them a good excuse to send back portions of their victims as proof that they mean business.

The Warriors have been employed to enter the Blighted Marshes and rescue the prisoners from the dungeons of the Chaos ratmen.

THE FIGHTING PIT
The prisoners are being kept below the fighting pit, in a network of cells and guardrooms. Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine the guardians of these cells, reading any Goblins as Skaven.

When the guardians are dead, each player rolls a dice. The number rolled is the number of prisoners his Warrior finds alive. Every prisoner a Warrior finds gives him 1D6x20 gold for freeing them.

At the bottom of the cell complex, there is a secret door that leads to the marshes above and to safety. In their weakened state the prisoners have not been able to open it, but the Warriors have no trouble. They soon smash it down and take the captives to freedom.
