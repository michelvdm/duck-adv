1 DESTROY THE WARPSTONE ICON

Rumours abound of a powerful long-lost Skaven artefact that has been rediscovered in the Worlds Edge Mountains. The artefact is a skull-shaped icon made from raw warpstone, and its mutating powers are said to be beyond imagination. The icon must be destroyed at all costs to stop the Skaven reclaiming it.

Unfortunately, the only way to destroy the icon is to hurl it into the cleansing flames of the firechasm.

SPECIAL RULES
The first dungeon room that the Warriors enter contains a sturdy iron casket holding the icon. When the Warriors have completed the room’s event, keep the dungeon room card next to the leader’s Adventure Record sheet to remind yourself the Warriors have the casket.

THE FIRECHASM
When the Warriors reach the firechasm, they must overcome the defenders of the chamber and hurl the warpstone icon into the flames.

To determine the Monsters that are guarding the firechasm, roll once on the Objective Room Monster Table.

If the icon is thrown into the chasm it is instantly consumed with a roar of lurid green flames. The room begins to collapse, and the Warriors must get out straight away or be crushed. To escape, the Warriors must cross the chasm and exit through a secret door that opens in the far wall, behind the stone dragon. The rules for crossing the chasm can be found above in the Crossing The Chasm section. The Warriors must escape within 2 turns of killing all the Monsters and hurting the icon into the chasm. After this point, the whole room caves in, killing any Warriors still inside.

Each Warrior who escapes the dungeon is rewarded with 1D6 x 100 gold for his part in the adventure.
