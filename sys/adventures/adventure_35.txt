5 NURGLE’S ROT

The city of Praag, which lies close to the border of the Chaos Wastes, has been struck with the dreaded Nurgle’s Rot, a disease spread by the foul Power of pestilence and decay The death toll is mounting, but the physicians in the city are powerless unless they can find a cure. There appears to be only one hope.

In the ancient myths and songs of Kislev, a fountain is described that has waters so pure and so cold that any creature harbouring any evil nature is frozen to death as soon as it touches the waters. The doctors of Praag believe that this may provide a cure for the disease.

The fountain is said to lie in the mountains north of the High Pass. The Warriors must seek it out and return with some of the precious liquid. They are given a special container in which to carry the water.

THE FOUNTAIN ROOM
First declare which Warrior is carrying the special container. Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine what Monsters the fountain room contains.

Once the Monsters are dead, the Warrior carrying the container may attempt to take the waters. To do so he must stand in a square adjacent to the fountain. Roll 1D6. If the result is a 1, the Warrior attempting to take the water isn’t deemed pure enough of spirit and is killed. On any other result the water is safely transferred to the special container. If the attempt fails, another Warrior may try.

As the first Warrior tries to take the waters he leans on one of the stone gargoyles’ heads surrounding the fountain. As he does so, it makes a soft click and an ominous creaking is heard from the far wall. With a groan of stone on stone, an ancient door slides open, leading to the outside world. 

The surviving Warriors may now take the water back to Praag. The Warrior bearing the water gets a 500 gold reward, while all the other Warriors get 100 gold each.
