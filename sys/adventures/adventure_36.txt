6 FOUNTAIN OF LOST SOULS

A mighty Sorcerer, resident in Marienburg, wishes to find the Burning Fountain, a mythical place rumoured to exist somewhere in the caves below the Dragonback Mountains. Scrying its exact location has proven to be of no use, but he has managed to obtain a picture of the fountain itself in his sorcerous mirror, confirming that it does indeed lie somewhere under the mountains, and is guarded by ferocious monsters.

No matter how much gold he offers, no one can be found to venture that far afield, so he has cunningly entrapped the four Warriors under a curse, capturing their souls in glowing gems. Using powerful magic, he has reached through his mirror and dropped these gems into the fountain.

The Warriors have no choice but to find the fountain and retrieve their lost souls. The gems must be returned to the Sorcerer before he can reunite the Warriorsâ€™ ethereal bodies with their physical bodies. He is apologetic about this underhand trick, but does promise rich rewards if the Warriors succeed in capturing some of the waters in a specially prepared container while they are there.

THE FOUNTAIN ROOM
Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine what Monsters the fountain room contains.

Once the Monsters are defeated, the Warriors may attempt to take the gems from the fountain. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior and add his Toughness. If the result is 6 or over, the Warrior survives the burning waters and retrieves his soul. If the number is 5 or less, the Warrior is consumed by the power of the water and dies in agony.

While getting his gem, a Warrior may collect some of the water for the Sorcerer.

If the Warriors return to the Sorcerer with some of the water he reunites their souls and bodies and gives each of them 2D6 x 50 gold.
