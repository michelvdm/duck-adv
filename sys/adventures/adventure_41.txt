1 EXORCISM

Deep below Middenheim there is a maze of tunnels inhabited by all manner of evil creatures. No-one ventures into this dark realm, and the entrances in the city have been sealed for centuries. Now, however, an evil presence has been detected by the priests of Ulric, the holy leaders of the city.

The source of this malign power is growing, and resides somewhere in the ancient catacombs below the city. The priests suspect it may be the spirit of a long dead Necromancer, returned to wreak havoc once again on the inhabitants of Middenheim. Like moths to a candle, other malign and twisted creatures are being drawn to the tunnels below Middenheim by this evil presence.

Carrying holy artefacts from the temples of the city, the Warriors must descend into the catacombs to exorcise the evil before its power grows too strong to contain.

SPECIAL RULES
Each Warrior has been given a holy symbol of Ulric to take into the dungeon below Middenheim. These artefacts must be placed on top of the Necromancerâ€™s tomb to lay him to rest.

THE TOMB CHAMBER
Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine what Monsters the tomb chamber contains.

Once the Monsters are defeated, each Warrior may move to a square adjacent to the tomb and lay his artefact on the tomb lid, in an attempt to exorcise the evil that dwells within it.

At the start of the next turn, during the Power Phase, each player must roll 1D6. If any of the dice score a 1, take another Event Card as the evil spirit summons vile creatures to his aid.

Once these are killed, the Warriors may try again. This continues until the Warriors do not roll any 1s, at which point the spirit is destroyed and the evil lifted. The Warriors may now make their way to the surface to be hailed as heroes. 

While in the tomb, the Warriors find 1D6 x 50 gold each, plus they get a further 1D6 x 50 gold each as reward for their part in the adventure.
