1 SACRIFICE?

One of the Warriors’ kinsmen has been captured by Orcs, and even now he is being tortured in their lair. He is to be sacrificed to their foul gods unless the Warriors can rescue him. 

SPECIAL RULES
Randomly determine the Warrior whose kinsman has been captured using the Warrior Counters. 

At the start of each Power Phase, before doing anything else, roll 3D6. If all the dice come up the same number the Warriors are too late - the prisoner has been sacrificed! You hear his agonised screams echoing down the dark tunnels. With the exception of the Warrior whose kinsman has just been sacrificed, the Warriors may choose whether to carry on and avenge the prisoner’s death, or to give up and return to the surface. The Warrior whose kinsman has been sacrificed has no choice, and he must go on and avenge the death of his blood relative. 

THE IDOL CHAMBER
Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine what Monsters the idol chamber contains. 

The Monsters are guarding the prisoner, who is bound in chains in front of a foul idol of Chaos. The Warrior who is his kinsman is so enraged by the sight of his relative like this that he goes insane with battle fury. For the rest of the game, that Warrior is at -1 Weapon Skill and +1 Attacks. Once the prisoner is freed, he shows the Warriors a secret way out of the dungeon that leads past a treasure chamber. From this room, each Warrior may take 2D6 x 50 gold to the surface with him.
