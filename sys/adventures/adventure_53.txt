3 KILL THE SHAMAN

A powerful Goblin Shaman is foretelling of a great Waaagh to come soon, when the Goblins and Orcs will sweep out of the Dark Lands and overthrow the Empire. Although not very powerful at the moment, his cult is growing stronger and unrest is beginning to stir. 

So as not to raise suspicions and warn him of his intentions, the Emperor has decreed that the best way to solve the crisis is to assassinate the Shaman. The Warriors have been chosen to venture into the Shaman’s lair below Mount Gunbad, on the far side of the Worlds Edge Mountains, and kill him. 

THE IDOL CHAMBER
When the Warriors reach the idol chamber they will find that it contains 11 Goblins plus the Shaman. The Goblins are placed on the board according to the normal rules, while the Shaman starts in a square adjacent to the idol at the far end of the room. 

The Shaman will avoid combat if possible. He is not subject to the normal rules for pinning, and may move around freely, always trying to stay as far away from the Warriors as he can. Apart from that, his profile is exactly the same as the other Goblins. The Shaman’s attack is to try and cast a ‘Hand of Mork’ spell at the Warriors at the start of each Monsters’ Phase. Roll 1D6. On a score of 4, 5 or 6 the spell succeeds. Use the Warrior Counters to
determine who is hit. That Warrior takes 1D6 x 2 Wounds, modified for Toughness and armour. 

Once all the Monsters in the room, including the Shaman, are dead, the Warriors find a concealed entrance behind the idol leading out into the light of day. They may carry the Goblin Shaman’s body back through this passage as evidence that they have killed him when they go back before the Emperor. If the mission is a success, each Warrior is rewarded with 1D6 x 50 gold.
