5 RETURN THE STAFF

As a final test of their courage and bravery before being accepted into the official Warriorsâ€™ Guild of Bretonnia, the Warriors must fulfil a challenging task. They must descend into the labyrinthine tunnels of the Cursed Pit, which lies below Cripple Peak near the Dark Lands, and place a staff in the hand of an idol hidden deep underground. The staff has magical properties, and if left anywhere other than in the hand of the idol, it will eventually return to the throne room of Bretonnia. 

THE IDOL CHAMBER
Roll on the Objective Room Monster Table to determine what Monsters the idol chamber contains. In addition, take the next Monster Event Card from the Event Deck and add those Monsters to those rolled. This is a particularly hazardous chamber! 

Once the Monsters are defeated, the Warriors may place the staff in the hand of the idol, completing their adventure. As they have killed all the Monsters in the vicinity already, they may now escape from the dungeon without danger. Upon their return to Bretonnia, the king rewards them with one item of treasure each. Take one Treasure Card for each Warrior.
