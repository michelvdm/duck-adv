The templates on the next page allow you to create your own Event Cards, using the cards in the Warhammer Quest box as a guide. 

Some of these Events show that Monsters have arrived - Shaven Assassins, for example (these cards have an ‘M’ in each top corner). You can base these Events around the Citadel miniatures in your own collection. You will find all the relevant information for most Monsters in the Bestiary Section of the Roleplay Book, including any special rules and Monsters’ gold values. As usual, when an Event Card which generates Monsters is completed, the
Warriors gain an item of treasure.

Some events do not involve Monsters at all, but may be fiendish traps. (These cards have an ‘E’ in each top corner). These can be transferred from the Dungeon Events table in the Roleplay Book, or they can even be of your own devising. You will find some blank Event Cards in the box. You’ll notice that at the bottom of these cards there are some boxes for you to tick. These are used to show what happens after the Event is completed. The ‘Yes’ box indicates that you do draw another Event Card or an item of Treasure, the ‘No’ box indicates that you don’t, and the ‘1-3’ box indicates that on a roll of 1-3 on a dice you do.

If your friends agree, you can use your own Event Cards in your games of Warhammer Quest. When you have tried a few events of your own, and found out that they work, you can transfer them on to the blank playing cards if you wish. This way, no one will be able to tell your cards from the pre-printed Event Cards in the game.
