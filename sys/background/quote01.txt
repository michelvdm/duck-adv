Beneath the world there are darker things than all the fear
and terror of man can conjure. things as black as darkest
hate.. They pray for our doom, they conjure foul daemons to
crush us. They amass armies of darkness and pestilence
unseen. And that, my students, is but the least of our
troubles.

-Lectures of Acrastorus Boehme of Altdorf
