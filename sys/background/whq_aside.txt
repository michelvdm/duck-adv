“Only my pride,” muttered the Dwarf from the bottom of the pit, ruefully nursing a sore head. 
“Sorry Skerri, I didn't catch that,” the Wizard's voice drifted down into the darkness. 
“Keep your Voice down, manling.” bellowed the Dwarf. “Of course I'm alright. I... errr... merely wished to investigate this.., errr... interesting perpendicular tunnel for secret doors.”

“Right then, you cunning know-it-all, let's be getting on. Where's this secret door you found?” The grinning Barbarian was almost quivering with anticipation of some treasure and a good fight. “Errr... did you, by any chance, think to bring the rope down with you?”
