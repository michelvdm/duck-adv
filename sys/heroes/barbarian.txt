THE BARBARIAN

The land of Norsca lies to the north of the Empire, across the Sea of Claws.

It is a bleak realm: a land of frozen fjords and towering snow-capped mountains: of ice, blizzards and freezing winds. This inhospitable expanse of rock and ice is inhabited by the Norse, some of the hardiest and most fearsome men in the Known World. 

The Horse are violent barbarians who are feared throughout the civilised world. The harsh conditions of their homeland have made them exceptionally tough and fierce, and they enjoy their drink almost as much as a good fight! To prove their valour the Horse warriors hunt the wolves and bears that prowl the icy wastes, and wear their pelts as protection against the cold.

Horse Barbarians are big, muscular, hardy fighters. They make great Warriors and sea-faring adventurers, and their exploits are famous the world over. These barbarous crews, in their dragon-headed longships, have plundered every shore from Araby to the Southlands.

Their love of battle makes the Horsemen excellent companions when venturing into danger. They are stalwart allies, unwilling to flee in even the most dangerous of situations. Their skill and courage in combat are renowned, and their love of plunder often leads them into places not frequented by saner men.

The Barbarian finds himself in the Worlds Edge Mountains, lured partly by the stories of immense treasure hoards, and partly by the opportunity to kill hundreds of Orcs, Goblins and other hideous creatures that he knows will be found in the dungeons deep below the earth.
