THE DWARF

The Dwarfs are an ancient race, and have lived in the Old World for thousands of years. Their cities have always been built beneath the ground. Tunnelled under the rocks and through the mountainsides they formed a vast empire under the earth. Through the centuries the Dwarfs' power grew, and as their tunnels delved ever deeper, the mountains yielded up their most valuable treasures - gold, silver, jewels and precious stones to swell the coffers of the Dwarf kings.

Hundreds of years ago, disaster struck when vast armies of Orcs and Goblins assaulted the Dwarf homeland. City after city fell in desperate battle, and today the Dwarfs retain only a tiny fraction of their great kingdom and the power they held in ages past. 

The Dwarfs are a long-lived people and immensely proud. They are very honourable, and never forget a debt they owe to another. They do tend to be bad-tempered, brusque, and intolerant of fools, but these bad points are more than offset by their steadfastness, reliability and loyalty to their companions. Though short, they are immensely strong and resilient, and wield their massive axes with great power and skill. 

Dwarfs have long memories, and never forget any wrong they or their family have suffered. They cherish the glorious memories of their past and yearn for the days when their greatest cities will ring again to the sound of Dwarf voices, and the Orcs and Goblins have been driven back to their squalid homes in the Darklands. 

All Dwarfs love treasure, especially gold. The Dwarf has joined the rest of the Warriors in the journey back to the lands of his ancestors in search of glory, lost treasures and vengeance. Every Orc killed, and every Goblin sent fleeing into the darkness, is a step towards the deliverance of his ancient birthright.
