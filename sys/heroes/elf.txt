THE ELF

The Dwarfs and the Elves enjoyed the golden age of their civilisations long before the empires of Man arose, and both are long-lived and noble races. There the similarity ends, however, as where the Dwarfs are short and stocky, the Elves are tall and slender. Where Dwarfs are gruff and serious, Elves are joyous and seem frivolous to other races. It was inevitable that the differences that lie between them should lead to a terrible and bitter war.

Though the war has ended, neither the Elves nor the Dwarfs will ever truly forgive nor forget, and an enduring mistrust now exists between their two races. 

Elves are tall, slender, pale-skinned and of haughty demeanour. Their slender build belies their strength and toughness, for Elves are powerful creatures, and deadly in battle. 

Their weapons and armour are the finest in the Warhammer World, crafted out of exquisite materials, using techniques unknown to Man, and encrusted in precious gems.

Elves generally keep themselves apart from the world of Men. Most of the Elves have abandoned the Old World and now make their home in the Elf kingdom of Ulthuan.

A few Elves still live in the forests of Loren. These Wood Elves are not as far distanced from the realms of humans as their High Elf kin. In times of dire threat to the Empire or the Kingdom of Bretonnia, the Wood Elves will even send mighty armies to fight alongside the human warriors in battle. 

Wood Elf adventurers are rare but not unheard of. The Elves' passion for bright jewels and gems, and their hatred of evil races such as Orcs and Goblins, can lead even them to undertake the most hazardous of adventures.

The Elf in Warhammer Quest is just such a Warrior - determined to recover lost treasures, experience new realms and rid the world of the hideous monsters who deface its beauty.
