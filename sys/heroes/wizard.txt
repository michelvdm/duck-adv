THE WIZARD

There is a power in the world that lies beyond the understanding of most mortal men, a power that can level mountains and destroy cities: the raw power of magic. 

The great High Elf Sorcerers have studied the lore of magic for thousands of years, and their sorcery goes far beyond the understanding of any other race. Their homeland, Ulthuan, is the most magical part of the Warhammer World, and in the far distant past the Elf mages taught some of their magic to men.

Since that time, the Wizards of mankind have established the Colleges of Magic and have been developing their skills. Magic is recognised as a potent force that can be used for good and for evil purposes.

All armies have powerful Battle Wizards who are skilled in spells of warfare and destruction. As men-at-arms clash on the field of battle, and as cannons roar and arrows fly, another battle is fought out between the rival spellcasters of the opposing armies. Magical energies surge and crackle above the battlefield as enemy Wizards strive for supremacy.

The Wizard seeks adventure in the dungeons and caves below the world. Not much is known about the evil creatures the Warriors will meet, but it is certain that there will be times when swords are of no use, and only magic will prevail. The Wizard will have to call on all his guile and wisdom to bring the Warriors to safety, and for their part the Warriors would be well advised to protect him.
