11 THROWN OUT

Your Warrior's wild behaviour attracts the attention of the Settlement authorities and he is thrown out of town. He must wait outside the Settlement gates for the other Warriors. While outside, he spends his Living Expenses as normal. 

In addition, roll 1D6. On a score of 1 your Warrior is fleeced by the sate guards as he is thrown out and has all his gold stolen.
