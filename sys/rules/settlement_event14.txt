14 GOOD DEED

Leaving most of his gold carefully stashed away in his hotel, your Warrior goes out on the town, taking 1D6 x 20 gold with him. As he crosses the street, he spots an old crone in an upstairs window shouting that robbers have broken into her attic room and are stealing her few possessions. Happy to assist the helpless, he bounds up the rickety stairs to her room three at a time. As he enters her dimly lit room, a black bag is placed over his head, swiftly followed by a heavy iron bar. He awakens in the gutter several hours later, nursing a sore head. Not surprisingly, the gold he was carrying has all gone.
