21 FIGHT

Your Warrior argues with a burly street trader who has tried to charge him far too much for some cheap, shoddy items. The argument escalates to a brawl very quickly. Roll 1D6 on the following table: 

1 Your Warrior is soundly thrashed and loses 200 gold. 

2 Your Warrior is bested after a hard struggle against the trader and his cronies and loses 100 gold.

3 Your Warrior walks away with a bloody nose and 50 gold worse off, but leaves the trader badly bruised.

4 After a fierce struggle, your Warrior knocks the impudent trader to the ground, where he stays to collect his teeth. While he is busy, your Warrior takes 100 gold from his stall as compensation.

5 Your Warrior quickly disarms the trader. With a sword at his throat, the lout has no choice but to apologise and offer your Warrior200 gold as compensation.

6 A dozen evil-looking thugs - the trader's bodyguards leap out from the shadows, attacking your Warrior with knives, coshes and cudgels. Unperturbed, he coolly dispatches them with a few well placed sword strokes, empties their purses, and ends up 300 gold better off.
