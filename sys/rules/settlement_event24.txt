24 CIRCUS

There is a travelling circus in town, and your Warrior spends the rest of his day wandering from sideshow to sideshow. Having met the bearded woman and the two-headed goat, he decides to have his fortune read.

Perhaps the sign above the door to that particular wagon should say 'Have your fortune stolen', as for a cost of 2D6 x 10 gold, your Warrior is told nothing more than that his destiny lies with a tall, dark stranger from Erengrad!
