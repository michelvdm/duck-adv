25 REWARD

Your Warrior sees a poster warning that a well known murderer is reputed to be in the area, and offers a reward for his capture. The criminal in question is described as very tall, wearing a black cloak and hat, and having an Erengrad accent. Upon reading this, your Warrior realises that the description exactly fits a character he bumped into earlier, and rushing back, manages to apprehend the villain just as he drags a gagged merchant into a dark alley.

Roll 1D6 on the following table:

1 The murderer laughs, slits the merchant's throat, throws the knife at your Warrior's feet and flees, shouting “Help, murder!”. Soon your Warrior is surrounded by an
angry mob, and only his best efforts (and 1D6 x 50) gold coins persuade them that he is innocent. 

2-5 Your Warrior saves the merchant's life, for which he gives you 20 gold, but the murderer slips away into the gloom. 

6 Your Warrior frees the merchant and captures the murderer, for which he is proclaimed a hero and given 100 gold reward.
