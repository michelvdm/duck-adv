35 DUEL

Your Warrior is challenged to a duel by a professional duellist whom he insulted in a tavern. The duel is scheduled to take place at dawn tomorrow. Your Warrior can either leave town immediately or take up the challenge. 

If your Warrior takes part in the duel, roll 1D6 on the following table: 

1 With a single, well-placed sword thrust your Warrior's heart is speared and he falls to the ground, quite dead.

2-4 The two duellists fight for hour after hour, each inflicting many light wounds on the other. Eventually the sun goes down and the fight is declared a draw. The duellist congratulates your Warrior on his swordsmanship, and offers him a fine supper and the best wine at the most expensive hotel in the Settlement

5-6 After a few minutes, your Warrior realises that he has the better of the duellist and despatches him. On his body he finds jewels worth 2D6 x 50 gold and a single item of treasure (take a Treasure card).
