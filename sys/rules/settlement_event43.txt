43 JOIN THE WATCH

The Captain of the Watch marks your Warrior as a useful looking recruit and, as he is short on manpower, press gangs him for a week. Your Warrior can either try to escape the Watch by making a donation to their funds of 2D6 x 10 gold, or join up.

If your Warrior joins up he does not have to pay Living Expenses for the week and earns 20 gold in wages. However, while in the Watch he has no time to visit any traders or Special Locations.
