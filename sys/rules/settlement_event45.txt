45 PET DOG

Your Warrior is adopted by a small dog. It follows him around everywhere, skulking in the shadows while the fighting goes on and then emerging after the adventure is completed to shower his new master with adoration. Unfortunately, his appetite is beyond all expectations for his size, and he doubles your Warrior's Living Expenses. 

Your Warrior can kill it if you want, but it would be a cruel and heartless thing to do and it will cost him 1,000 gold to pay for a decent burial for the hound!

If your Warrior already has a pet dog, roll on this table again. If not, name him and note him down on your Warrior's Adventure Record sheet.
