46 RUNAWAY

While walking along the main street, your Warrior hears a disturbance just around the corner. A moment later a huge runaway bull charges down the street, wrecking market stalls and causing panic. Your Warrior can let it pass by hiding down a side alley, or try to stop the enraged animal. 

If your Warrior hides down the alley and lets the bull pass, roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 Your Warrior skulks in the shadows, waiting for the action to die down. As he peeps round the corner, a mugger's metal bar hits him over the head. When he regains consciousness, his purse is 100 gold coins lighter.

4-6 After waiting nervously in the dark for a few minutes, your Warrior sees the bull roar past and career off down a side street. The danger is passed and your Warrior may carry on about his business.

If your Warrior tries to stop the bull, roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-2 Your Warrior waves the passers-by aside and leaps out in front of the bull, sword drawn. The bull hesitates for half a second or so, and then tramples him into the dirt before carrying on its way. The crowd then stomp all over him in the rush to follow the bull, leaving him to nurse his injuries alone in an empty street.

3-4 A single sword thrust stops the bull dead in its tracks literally. As its carcass twitches spasmodically, the crowd roar in approval and shower your Warrior with 100 gold. Then the bull's enraged owner arrives, and relieves him of 150 gold - it was his prize stud, and he wanted it stopped, not slaughtered!

5-6 Your Warrior gives the bull a hard stare and it skids to a halt, snorting and pawing the ground. Putting a rope around its neck, he leads it back to its stall. The crowd cheer and shower him with 150 gold.
