Your Warrior is accused of murder and thrown in jail. The matter is sorted out eventually, but only after your Warrior's companions have bailed him out.

Each Warrior in the party except the accused must pay 1D6 x 5 gold to the authorities.

If his companions do not have the money, your Warrior must spend 1D6 days in jail. While in jail he doesn't have to pay Living Expenses or roll on this table.
