53 COUNTERFEIT

As your Warrior attempts to buy some equipment, the trader points out his gold is counterfeit and refuses to take it. Looking through his stash, your Warrior discovers tha+1D6 x 10 of his gold is indeed worthless. Discard it and cross it off his Adventure Record sheet. 

If your Warrior does not have that much gold left, and has already spent some in the Settlement, he must leave for the next dungeon immediately before anyone catches on.
