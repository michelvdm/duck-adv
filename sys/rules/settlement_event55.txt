55 DEBT

A debt collector catches up with your Warrior, demanding payment for money borrowed years ago. The sum your Warrior borrowed was not substantial, but the interest rates are astronomical. The outstanding balance is 1D6 x 20 gold, and if your Warrior cannot pay in full immediately the debt collector takes all his gold plus one piece of equipment or treasure.
