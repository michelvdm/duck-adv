61 TEMPLE DONATION

Much taken with the teachings of the local priest, your Warrior pledges 1D6 x 50 gold to his cause, selling equipment if necessary to meet the cost of the
donation. The next time your Warrior is in a fight and fails to hit his opponent, the sect's deity shines on him and he may re-roll the attack. He may only do this once for each donation he makes (i.e., each time he rolls this result on this table.)
