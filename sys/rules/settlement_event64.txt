64 WITCHCRAFT

Your Warrior is accused of witchcraft, and is chased through the streets by an angry mob. Roll 1D6 on the following table: 

1-3 Your Warrior escapes by jumping over the Settlement wall and into the filthy water of the moat. Pelted with eggs and rotten fruit, he staggers out onto the far side, where he has to wait outside for his companions.

4-5 Your Warrior ducks down a side alley and escapes, but from now on must wear a disguise when out in public! 

6 Your Warrior turns angrily on the mob, demanding an explanation. Shouting down the leader of the mob, he establishes his authority over the crowd, who sheepishly return to their hovels, pausing only to give him 100 gold as way of compensation.
