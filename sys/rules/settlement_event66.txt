66 ACCIDENT

As your Warrior helps an old crone to cross the busy main street, an beer wagon unexpectedly crashes into him. She carefully peels him off the heavy, iron-shed wheel, and takes him to the infirmary to be patched up. Your Warrior cannot buy anything or visit any Special Locations for 1D6 days while he recovers. While he is recovering you do not have to roll for him on this table.
