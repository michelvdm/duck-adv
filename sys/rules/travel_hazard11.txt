11 MASSACRE
The Warriors come across a burning wagon in a forest clearing. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the highest score recognises the dying
travellers as his blood kin. One of them is able to tell the Warriors who perpetrated the massacre. Roll 1D6:
1 Goblins 4 Dark Elves
2 Skaven 5 Chaos Warriors
3 Orcs 6 Beastmen
From now on, the Warrior whose kin have been slaughtered Hates this type of Monster (see the Psychology section). Note this down on his Adventure
Record sheet. Every time he kills one of these Monsters, this Warrior gains an extra 5 gold on top of the Monster's Gold Value.
