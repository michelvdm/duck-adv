14 QUAKE

The ground opens up in front of the Warriors, creating an impassable chasm many miles long. The Warriors have three choices:

a) Abandon any hope they have of reaching a Settlement, in which case they must go straight into the next adventure.
b) Go back to the caves they just left and start their journey again from scratch taking a different route. 
c) Use any length of rope that they have to cross the chasm. If they cross the chasm with a rope, they may not take horses, carts, etc, with them, and must discard the rope once they have safely reached the other side
