15 STRANGER

The Warriors meet a stranger who asks where they are heading. After being told, he says that he too is going that way, knows a shortcut, and will pay each Warrior 40 gold to let him join them. After all, he explains, there is safety in numbers.

The Warriors must let him join them. Roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 The stranger does not know the way and the party is soon lost add 1D6 weeks to the length of the journey. He is apologetic, however, and when the Warriors finally arrive, he pays each of them 40 gold as promised.
4-5 The stranger's short cut turns out to be no quicker. Upon reaching civilisation, he pays the Warriors 40 gold each.
6 The stranger does know the way well, knocking a week off the Warriors' journey time. Upon arrival at their destination, he gratefully pays each Warrior the 40 gold as promised.
