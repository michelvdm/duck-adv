16 PEDLAR

The Warriors are stopped by a pedlar a strange-looking individual wearing brightly coloured rags and carrying a number of wicker baskets in which he
keeps his wares. He capers from side to side, playing a piping tune on a reedy flute. The Warriors may buy things from him:

• Healing Potion. 50 gold. Heals 1D6 Wounds. One use.
• Lucky Charm. 50 gold. A Warrior wearing this may re-roll any single dice roll once per adventure.
• Bronze Wristbands. 30 gold. A Warrior wearing these may ignore 1 Wound during any single combat. One use, then they are broken.
• Chalk. 20 gold. A Warrior with chalk may mark an escape route out of the dungeon and therefore needs not roll on the Escape Table (from the
Adventure Book) should he wish to leave the dungeon. One use.
• Trinkets. 20 gold. If on the Warriors' travels anyone demands gold from them for any reason they can try and give them these trinkets instead.
Roll 1D6. On a score of 1, 2 or 3 they refuse the trinkets and insist on being given the gold. On a score of 4, 5 or 6 they accept the trinkets
instead of the gold. Trinkets are only acceptable to fellow travellers, and are never accepted as payment for anything in a Settlement.

Each Warrior may buy a maximum of one of each item, except trinkets, which he may buy up to six of.

Once the Warriors have made their purchases, the pedlar vanishes into the woods. Now roll 1D6 for each object the Warriors have bought. If the result is a 1, that item is shoddily made and is useless. The Warrior has been conned and must discard the item immediately.
