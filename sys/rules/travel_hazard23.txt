23 PLAGUE

The Warriors arrive at a large town in the grip of the plague and all roads, bar the one the Warriors entered by, are blocked. The Warriors' journey is over, and they must now either go straight onto the next adventure or stop and spend some time in the town.

If the Warriors stay use the normal rules to determine what they do there (see the Settlements section), but each time you make a roll on any table for your Warrior also roll 1D6 on the following table:

1 Your Warrior contracts the plague. He is at -1 Strength for the duration of the next dungeon
2 Your Warrior contracts the plague. He is at -1 Toughness for the duration of the next dungeon.
3-6 Your Warrior remains unaffected by the plague - for now!
