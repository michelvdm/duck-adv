25 PRISONER

As the Warriors approach the crest of a hill, they hear the noise of armed men approaching. Taking cover, they watch as a band of swarthy mercenaries troops by, dragging a wealthy-looking man behind them. The Warriors can either fight the mercenaries and free the prisoner, or let
them pass unhindered. If the Warriors attack the mercenaries, roll 1D6 on the following table.

1-2 The mercenaries drive the Warriors off, taking some of their gold. Each Warrior loses 1D6 x 10 gold.

3-4 The Warriors kill the mercenaries after a long struggle, but not quickly enough to prevent them slaughtering the prisoner. The
Warriors each find 1D6 x 20 gold if they search the bodies of the fallen.

5-6 The Warriors best the mercenaries in a fierce fight, and free the prisoner. He cannot travel very fast, and if the Warriors take him
with them he adds one week to their journey time. Upon arriving at their destination, he gives each Warrior 100 gold for rescuing him.
