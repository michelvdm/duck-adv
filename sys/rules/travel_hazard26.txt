26 GUESTS

The Warriors arrive in a small hamlet as a local festival is in full swing, and they are invited to stay as guests. They are wined and fed to excess, and have a most enjoyable evening.

Waking up the next morning, they feel it is only fair to offer payment for the hospitality that the villagers have offered. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score has to pay the villagers (1D6 x 20) gold. If two or more Warriors score equally low, they must roll off until only one player is left to foot the bill!
