32 FAMINE

On the Warriors' travels, they pass through lands cursed by famine and drought. Proving himself the worthy hero that he is, each Warrior gives the
poverty stricken peasants a proportion of his gold. Roll 1D6 for each Warrior on the following table:

1-2 Your Warrior gives any one item of treasure to the peasants

3 Your Warrior gives 100 gold to the poor 4-5 Your Warrior gives 1D6 x 10 gold to the poor.

6 Touched by your kindness and concern, the village elder brings a carefully wrapped sword out of his house, presenting it to your
Warrior in exchange for 1D6 x 50 gold. The magical blade is a Sword of Sharpness, and each time it is used it causes +2 Wounds on any Monster it hits. However, the sword can never be sold, as any attempt to get rid of it results in it mysteriously finding its way back to the village. 

If more than one player rolls a 6, draw a Warrior counter to determine whose Warrior gets the sword and roll again for the other Warriors.
