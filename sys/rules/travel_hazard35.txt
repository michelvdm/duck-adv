35 POOL OF DREAMS

The Warriors come across a deep pool of freezing water on top of a mountain. 

Its surface is like a mirror, with shifting images drifting across its still, icy surface. As the Warriors gaze into the chill waters, they see twisted reflections of themselves, fighting for their lives against the most hideous Monsters. Roll 1D6 on the following table for each Warrior.

1-3 Although he can see these reflections, the Warrior cannot make any sense of them.

4-6 The Warrior realises that he is being granted a vision of the future! At any time during the next dungeon, he may ignore any one blow that would otherwise hit him. The Warrior recognises the blow before it hits home as the vision from the pool, and dodges away just in time. Note
this on his Adventure Record sheet, crossing it off when he uses it.
