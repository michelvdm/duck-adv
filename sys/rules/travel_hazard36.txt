36 LIGHTNING

As the Warriors are setting up camp on the top of a hill, a storm gathers above them. The sky blackens and grows dim, and thunder rolls. The next instant a lightning bolt streaks from the sky, hitting one of the Warriors on the head. 

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score is hit by lightning, melting his armour. He loses two items of armour (a shield and a
helmet, for instance). If the Warrior doesn't have two items of armour, the armour he does wear is melted, and the lightning bolt sets his clothes alight too - he arrives in the next Settlement in tattered, charred rags and must therefore buy new robes and new boots.
