45 WHICH ROAD?

The road splits into two before the Warriors. One road leads to their chosen destination, but from their map it is impossible to tell which. Do they take the left fork or the right fork? 

Once the players have agreed which road the Warriors take, roll 1D6 on the following table:

1-3 The Warriors chose the correct path and may continue on their journey.
4-6 The Warriors took the wrong route and end up at a small village, finishing their journey prematurely.
