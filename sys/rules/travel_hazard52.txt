52 BLIZZARD

A blizzard howls across the land, swathing all in white. Unprepared, the Warriors are trapped in a bitterly cold landscape where visibility is reduced to a few yards and movement is almost impossible through the banked drifts of snow. The Warriors abandon all hope of reaching a town or city, and take refuge in the nearest village, cutting their journey short. They may buy equipment there as normal. After the blizzard abates, the Warriors may go straight into the next dungeon.
