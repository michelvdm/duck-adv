54 ROCKFALL

As the Warriors trek through a dark ravine, there is a dull rumbling above them. A few seconds later a shower of rocks and boulders comes crashing
down, blocking their route completely. Although they can still complete their journey without losing any time, they must employ local labourers to clear a path, costing each Warrior 1D6 x 20 gold.
