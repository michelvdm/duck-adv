61 MILITIA

The Warriors see smoke curling above the trees, and within a few minutes reach the crest of a hill overlooking a small Settlement. As they get closer, a group of armed men on horseback approach. They are the town militia and are very wary of strangers. They refuse to let the Warriors stay at the Settlement, hut for a payment of 30 gold each will allow them to pass through it. If the Warriors refuse to pay, they must go around the village and the surrounding fields, adding one week to their journey.
