62 BRIGANDS

As the Warriors reach the outskirts of a small Settlement, they are set upon by brigands demanding gold. They outnumber the Warriors, but seem wary of their superior arms and armour. The Warriors have a choice: they can either pay the brigands or fight them.

If the Warriors decide to pay the brigands, each Warrior must give up 1D6 x 20 gold.

If the Warriors fight the brigands, roll 1D6 for each Warrior and add them together. This is the total number of brigands that the Warriors are fighting.

Then roll another 1D6 for each Warrior and add them together. This is the total number of brigands that the Warriors manage to kill. 

If there are any brigands left alive after this, then they overpower the Warriors, steal 1D6 x 50 gold from each of them, and disappear into the shadows.
