64 FALL

Roll 1D6 for each Warrior. The Warrior with the lowest score trips over a log and breaks his ankle. How embarrassing! Dragging him along slows the party down, adding two weeks to the journey. When the Warriors reach a Settlement, it costs the injured Warrior 30 gold to have his ankle healed.
